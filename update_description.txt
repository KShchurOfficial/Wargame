-!--!--!--!- Update 1.0.2 -!--!--!--!-

1) Game process updated for playing with 3 or 4 players. Now users will play pair matches with each other.
To win, player should destroy all divisions of enemy. If it is, player receive 1 score point. When all games will
played, program will show the table of score points of each player and then it will recognize winner.

2) Now players have an ability to equip more divisions while playing the match.

3) Crates with boosts were added. Now there are 4 types of it: 
	crate with coins (give 50-150 coins)
	medkit crate (recovers health of division)
	crate with arsenal improvement (increases average damage of division)
 	optics crate (increases divisions chance of doing critical damage and decreases divisions chance of miss)
All types have unequal chance of spawn:
	Coins crate - 50%
	Medkit crate - 25%
	Arsenal crate - 15%
	Optics crate - 10%
Three last types of crates have 3 levels. The higher level of crate, the less chance of spawn and
the more power of boost it has. 




4) The class "List" has replaced by its more universal version named "Unilist". 
Now, I can use construction "linked list" for storing not only divisions, but
also for crates of boost.
